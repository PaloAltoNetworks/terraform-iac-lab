Congratulations!  You have completed the hands-on Infrastructure as Code lab.

What We've Accomplished
-----------------------
We've completed the following activities:

- **Configure:** We used Terraform to prepare Panorama for bootstrapping by configuring a device group, template, and 
  template stack.

- **Deployment:** We built out our application in GCP using Terraform, and used the bootstrap capability of VM-Series
  to automatically retrieve the desired configuration from Panorama.
